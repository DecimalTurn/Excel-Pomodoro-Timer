# To contribute

Contributions to this project are welcome. 
As you can see, there is no *.xlsb file in the repository. Instead, Assembler.bas contains the code that generates the worbkook (sheets, table, content, etc.) and the source code for modules, forms and named ranges is located in the src directory.
To submit a pull request, please export your changes as *.bas files manually or using a VBA version control tool such as [VbaDeveloper](https://github.com/DecimalTurn/vbaDeveloper).
